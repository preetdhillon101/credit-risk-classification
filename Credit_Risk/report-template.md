### Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis was to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a loan is healthy or high-risk. The data set consisted of 77,500 rows, including columns with information on loan amount, interest rate, borrower's income, debt, accounts, and a column labeling each loan as either healthy or high-risk. Out of the total loans, only 2,500 were labeled as high-risk.

### Machine Learning Process

To build the model, the following steps were taken:

1. **Data Preparation**: The data was split into labels and features, with the loan status (healthy or high-risk) as the label, and the remaining seven columns as features.
2. **Data Splitting**: The data was divided into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Selection**: A Logistic Regression model from sklearn was chosen, using the Limited-memory BFGS ('lbfgs') solver. Logistic Regression was selected because it effectively handles binary classification tasks.
4. **Model Training**: The model was trained using the training data.
5. **Prediction**: The model made predictions on the test data.
6. **Evaluation**: The model's predictions were compared with the actual test labels to evaluate its performance.

### Results

- **Accuracy**: 0.99185
- **Balanced Accuracy**: 0.95205
- **Precision**:
  - Healthy: 1.00
  - High-Risk: 0.85
- **Recall**:
  - Healthy: 0.99
  - High-Risk: 0.91

### Summary

The Logistic Regression model performs very well in predicting healthy loans. However, it incorrectly classifies 10% of high-risk loans as healthy. Despite the fact that none of the training loans are for large amounts (all under $24,000), a defaulted loan, especially early in its term, could lead to significant financial losses that outweigh the interest earned from multiple healthy loans.

Additionally, the model had relatively few high-risk loans to learn from compared to the number of healthy loans. Increasing the number of high-risk loans in the training data could potentially improve the model's performance.

For loan classification, it is crucial to prevent high-risk loans, as the financial loss from a single defaulted loan can be greater than the interest gained from several healthy loans.
